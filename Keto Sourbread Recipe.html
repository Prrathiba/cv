In a separate bowl add egg whites, eggs, buttermilk, sauerkraut juice, and water.  Whisk until frothy on top.
Slowly add wet ingredients to dry ingredients.  Mix well just until incorporated.
Divide and portion dough into small loaves.  Use a kitchen scale to make rolls all equal in size.
Score the tops of each roll with a sharp knife.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until the bottoms and edges of each roll are light golden brown.
Remove from oven and brush tops of each roll with melted butter, then sprinkle with a little salt and Italian seasoning.  Place back in the oven under broil for 2-3 minutes until tops are a deep golden brown and crisp.  Keep an eye on the rolls to make sure you do not burn them.
